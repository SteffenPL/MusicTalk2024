# Scripts for JuliaCon Talk 2024

The following files contain two tracks for the presentation. 
Suggestions of how to turn `init_session.jl` into a package are welcome. For a proper package, it requires a proper ahead of time scheduler for MIDI messages.

`tracks/talk_1.jl` is based on [Andrew Sorensen Keynote: "The Concert Programmer" - OSCON 2014 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY1FSsUV-8c).
